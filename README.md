This Repository contains required resources to reproduce the results for my COMP0029 individual project.


***WARNING: The data and notebooks all contain content that is racist, sexist, homophobic, and offensive in many other ways.***


You can find the labeled data as a pickle file in the `data` directory. You can also find a notebook in the `src` directory containing Python 3 code to replicate my analyses.
