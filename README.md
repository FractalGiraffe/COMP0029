This Repository contains required resources to reproduce the results for my COMP0029 individual project, "On the Federated Detection of Hate Speech".


***WARNING: The data and notebooks all contain content that is racist, sexist, homophobic, and offensive in many other ways.***


You can find the labeled data as a pickle file in the `data` directory. You can also find a notebook in the `src` directory containing Python 3 code to replicate my analyses. 

## Project Setup

Start by opening the notebook in Google Colab. Save a copy of the notebook in Drive and upload the dataset to Drive, under `COMP0029/labeled_data.p`. Finally, run the copy of the notebook.
