        "The optimization problem implicit in federated learning is known as the federated optimization problem, drawing a contrast to the distributed optimization problem. The key properties that differentiate federated optimization are: unbalanced data (different clients can hold different amounts of data) and that the IID assumption, $\\forall k.\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathcal{P}_k}[F_k(w)] = f(w)$, does not hold. That is to say that $F_k$ could be an arbitrarily bad approximation to $f$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here we focus on horizontal federated learning, where the clients share the same feature space but different sample space (in contrast to vertical federated learning, where the clients have different feature and sample spaces).\n",
        "\n",
        "An [existing study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04977.pdf) gives a taxonomy of non-IID data distribution cases. Consider the local data distribution $P(x_i, y_i)$. We can rewrite $P(x_i, y_i)$ as $P(x_i | y_i)P(y_i)$ and $P(y_i | x_i)P(x_i)$ so that we can more precisely show the differences between cases. The study gives 5 different non-IID cases:\n",

        "\n",
        "Here, (3) is mainly related to vertical FL (the clients share the same sample IDs but different features). (4) is not applicable in most FL studies, which assume there is a common knowledge $P(y|x)$ among the clients to learn. (2) can be simulated on a dataset by adding different levels of noise to different partitions. In computer vision, these transformations can be done on the fly, using data generators e.g. for Gaussian noise. However, [this isn't the case with NLP](https://neptune.ai/blog/data-augmentation-nlp) due to the grammatical structure of the text; a new carefully augmented dataset must be generated beforehand.\n",
        "\n",

We sample $q ∼ Dir_N (β)$, and allocate a $q_j$ proportion of the total data samples to ${\\mathcal{P}}_j$ . The distribution parameter, $β>0$, can be used to control the degree of imbalance. The smaller $β$ is, the more imbalanced the distribution.\n",

This is first introduced in [the experiments of FedAvg](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.05629.pdf), where each client is only assigned 2 subsets of the data, with different labels. Such a setting is also used in other studies, [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10342.pdf) and [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06127.pdf). [Here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10342.pdf)  a highly extreme case is considered, where each client only has data samples with a single label. We use a general partitioning strategy to set the number of labels that each client has; in the context of our study, this is either 1 or 2."
